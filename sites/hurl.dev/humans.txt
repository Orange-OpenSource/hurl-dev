Hurl is a command line tool that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format.

A simple sample with multiple requests:

    # First request, create a contact, and
    # capture its id:
    # ------------------------------------

    POST https://example.net/api/contacts
    [FormParams]
    token: {{token}}
    email: toto@rookie.net
    HTTP 201
    [Captures]
    contact-id: jsonpath "$.id"

    # Second request, a simple GET on this contact
    # with an assert on its properties:
    # ------------------------------------

    GET https://example.net/api/contacts/{{contact-id}}
    HTTP 200
    [Asserts]
    jsonpath "$.id" == "toto@rookie.net"

    # Third request, delete it!
    # ------------------------------------

    DELETE https://example.net/api/contacts/{{contact-id}}
    HTTP 200
