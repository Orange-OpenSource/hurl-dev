Christmas has been busy for the Hurl team! We're happy to announce __Hurl 2.0.0__, with a lot of new features
and bug fixes. If you don't know [Hurl], it's a command line tool powered by [curl] that runs HTTP requests defined in 
a simple text format:

{% raw %}
```hurl
# Create a new cat:
POST https://example.org/api/cats
{
 "name": "Kitty",
 "color": "black"
}
HTTP 201
[Captures]
cat-id: jsonpath "$.id"


# Get our new cat:
GET https://example.org/api/cats/{{cat-id}}
HTTP 200                                
[Asserts]
jsonpath "$.lives" == 9
```
{% endraw %}

Hurl can be used to get data like [curl], or as a __testing tool for JSON/XML apis__ and HTML content.

So, __what's new in 2.0.0__?

- [GraphQL Query Support]
- [Processing Data with Filters]
- [Various curl Options]
- [Minor Syntax Changes]


## GraphQL Query Support

Hurl can now be used to send [GraphQL] query request very easily. The syntax is natural and use <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code> body with a `graphql` hint.

For instance, using [GitHub GraphQL APIs], we can check the number of stars of a project:

{% raw %}
~~~hurl
POST https://api.github.com/graphql
Authorization: bearer {{token}}
```graphql
{
  repository(owner: "Orange-OpenSource", name: "hurl") {
    stargazerCount
  }
}
```
HTTP 200
~~~
{% endraw %}

And this Hurl file can be run like this:

```shell
$ hurl --variable token=FOO github.hurl | jq
[1m{
  [0m[1;34m"data"[0m[1m: [0m[1m{
    [0m[1;34m"repository"[0m[1m: [0m[1m{
      [0m[1;34m"stargazerCount"[0m[1m: [0m3578[1m
    [1m}[0m[1m
  [1m}[0m[1m
[1m}[0m
```


It's a very _"Markdowny"_ syntax which re-use existing Hurl [multiline body].

GraphQL queries, of course, can use GraphQL variables:

{% raw %}
~~~hurl
POST https://api.starwars.com/graphql
```graphql
query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}

variables {
  "episode": "JEDI"
}
```
HTTP 200
~~~
{% endraw %}

And, as any multiline body, GraphQL queries can be templatized with Hurl variables!

{% raw %}
~~~hurl
POST https://api.starwars.com/graphql
```graphql
query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}

variables {
  "episode": {{episode}}
}
```
HTTP 200
~~~
{% endraw %}


As GraphQL APIs return JSON, we can add asserts on the HTTP response:

{% raw %}
~~~hurl
POST https://api.starwars.com/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: "1000") {
    name
    height
  }
}
```

HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath "$.data.human.name" == "Luke Skywalker"
jsonpath "$.data.human.height" == 1.72
~~~
{% endraw %}


## Processing Data with Filters

Sometimes you want to process response body before capturing data or adding tests. 

Let's say we have an endpoint that returns an HTTP header `x-servers` containing a joined list of servers (for instance `rec1.org,rec3.org`). 
You want to test the value of this header: number of server, value of server 1 etc... You can now use [filters] 
to process the response headers and add clean asserts:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api

HTTP 200
[Asserts]
header "x-servers" split "," count == 2
header "x-servers" split "," nth 0 == "rec1.org"
header "x-servers" split "," nth 1 == "rec3.org"
jsonpath "$.books" count == 12
```

In this sample, `header "x-servers"` extracts the HTTP header from the response. Then, we have a chain of two filters
`split "," nth 0`. The first filter `split` turns the header to a list, and the second filter, `nth`, returns an element of the list. 
Then we have our final test with `== "rec1.org"`.

<div class="schema-container schema-container u-font-size-1 u-font-size-3-md">
 <div class="schema">
    <span class="schema-token schema-color-2">header "x-servers"<span class="schema-label">query</span></span>
    <span class="schema-token schema-color-1">split "," nth 0<span class="schema-label">2 filters</span></span>
    <span class="schema-token schema-color-3">== "rec1.org"<span class="schema-label">predicate</span></span>
 </div>
</div>


Filters can also be applied on captures:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api

HTTP 200
[Captures]
name: jsonpath "$user.id" replace "\\d" "x" # Make our user anonymous 
```

Let's take a final example, with a live existing service that 
returns a CSV of stock exchanges <https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges>

First, we split our response body by lines and save it in a variable `lines`.

```hurl
GET https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges

HTTP 200
[Captures]
rows: body split "\n"
```

Then, we create two other variables `australia` and `algeria` that are row 7 and 18.

```hurl
GET https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges

HTTP 200
[Captures]
rows: body split "\n"
australia: variable "rows" nth 7 split ","
algeria: variable "rows" nth 18 split ","
```

Now that we have our row 7 and 18, we can add assert on specifics columns:

```hurl
GET https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges

HTTP 200
[Captures]
lines: body split "\n"
australia: variable "lines" nth 7 split ","
algeria: variable "lines" nth 18 split ","
[Asserts]
variable "australia" nth 1 == "Australia & Oceania"
variable "australia" nth 2 == "Australia"
variable "algeria" nth 1 == "Africa"
variable "algeria" nth 2 == "Algeria"
```

Filters can be used to transform the HTTP response data easily. We have included a [first round of filters] `count`, 
`htmlEscape`, `htmlUnescape`, `nth`, `regex`, `replace`, `split`, `toInt`, `urlDecode` and `urlEncode`. Don't hesitate to give us some
feedbacks on this nice new feature!

## Various curl Options

Under the hood, Hurl uses [curl] for HTTP transfers. We have implemented the following curl options: [`-E/--cert`], [`--connect-to`],
[`--key`], [`--resolve`] and [`--ssl-no-revoke`]. For instance, given this Hurl file `hello.hurl`:

~~~hurl
GET http://foo.com/hello
HTTP 200
`Hello World!`

GET http://bar.com/hello
HTTP 200
`Hello World!`

GET http://baz.com/hello
HTTP 200
`Hello World!`
~~~

You can force the resolution of `foo.com`, `bar.com` and `baz.com` to `localhost` with [`--connect-to`]:

```shell
$ hurl --connect-to foo.com:80:localhost:8000 \
       --connect-to bar.com:80:localhost:8000 \
       --connect-to baz.com:80:localhost:8000 \
       hello.hurl
```

## Minor Syntax Changes

Astute readers have already spot some minor syntax changes. Instead of __`HTTP`__ for wildcard HTTP version test, you can simply
write __`HTTP`__ now (the first syntax still work but is deprecated)

```hurl
# New Syntax
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200

# Deprecated syntax
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200
```

If you want to add precise tests on HTTP version, you can still use `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2`:

```hurl
GET https://foo.com
HTTP/2 200

GET https://bar.com
HTTP/1.1 200

GET https://baz.com
HTTP/1.0 200
```

Thanks to [@jmoore34] for this idea, it's obvious now you see it!

Finally, plain text body have been tweaked, to allow the use of a language hint like `graphql` or `json`:

- Post a CSV:

  ~~~hurl
  POST https://example.com/csv
  ```
  line1,red,1
  line2,green,2
  line3,green,3
  ```
  ~~~
  
- Use a GraphQL query

  ~~~hurl
  POST https://example.com/graphql
  ```graphql
  {
    human {
      name
      }
  }
  ```
  ~~~

- Post a JSON body

  ~~~hurl
  POST https://example.com/json
  ```json
  {
    "name": "toto",
    "age": 18
  }
  ```
  ~~~

- Post a JSON body without <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code> (this shorter syntax is prefered over the previous one)

  ```hurl
  POST https://example.com/json
  {
    "name": "toto",
    "age": 18
  }
  ```

- And finally, post a single string without newline:

  ```hurl
  POST https://example.com/csv
  `Hello world!`
  ```

You may notice that the syntax takes huge inspiration from Markdown and that's _very intentional_!
