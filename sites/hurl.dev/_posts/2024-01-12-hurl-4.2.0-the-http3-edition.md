[Hurl] is a command line tool powered by [curl], that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/tests/4567
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
header "x-foo" contains "bar"
certificate "Expire-Date" daysAfterNow > 15
jsonpath "$.status" == "RUNNING"    # Check the status code
jsonpath "$.tests" count == 25      # Check the number of items
jsonpath "$.id" matches /\d{4}/     # Check the format of the id
```

## HTTP/3 Support

Hurl HTTP engine is powered by [curl], one of the most reliable HTTP libraries, available in millions of softwares, devices
(TVs, cars, printers etc..), and is [even used on Mars]. In details, Hurl is written in Rust, offloading the HTTP 
layer to [libcurl]. We like this design a lot because Hurl benefits directly from curl's power and capabilities "for
free", adding some nice [asserts] and [captures] possibilities to chain and test HTTP requests.

Started with [Hurl 4.2.0], Hurl supports now [HTTP/3]! Running a Hurl file with HTTP/3 can be done on the command line, 
with [`--http3`] option:

```shell
$ hurl --http3 test.hurl
```

Like curl, there are also [`--http2`], [`--http1.1`] and [`--http1.0`] options to force a certain version of HTTP. With 
[options sections], we can specify an HTTP version per request, in the same Hurl file:

```hurl
GET https://myserver.com
[Options]
http3: true
HTTP/3 200

GET https://myserver.com
[Options]
http2: true
HTTP/2 200
```

To use HTTP/3, the underlying libcurl used by Hurl must expose HTTP/3 features. Simply run `hurl --version` to check
which libcurl features are supported:

```shell
$ hurl --version
hurl 4.2.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin23.0) libcurl/8.1.2 (SecureTransport) LibreSSL/3.3.6 zlib/1.2.12 nghttp2/1.55.1
Features (libcurl):  alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 IPv6 Largefile libz NTLM NTLM_WB SPNEGO SSL UnixSockets
Features (built-in): brotli
```

> If installed on macOS with [Homebrew], Hurl uses the system libcurl that does not support HTTP/3 yet. To use HTTP/3 on macOS, 
> you can: 
> 
> 1. compile your own version of libcurl to support HTTP/3. Cloudflare has a simple Homebrew formula to [build libcurl with HTTP/3]
> 2. [link Hurl with this updated libcurl]
> 3. Enjoy!

There are very few HTTP clients that support HTTP/3, so we're very happy with this new feature and look forward for 
feedbacks!

## Install With conda-forge

Thanks to [@humphd], a recurring provider of new features, Hurl can now be installed through [conda-forge], a
community-led packet manager for Conda:

```shell
$ conda install -c conda-forge hurl
```

conda-forge Hurl installation supports macOS, Linux, Windows, on x86 and ARM 64 bits architectures so we've got you 
covered!

What's very interesting with conda-forge is that other packet managers use it as a distribution source. For instance,
[pixi], a powerful and fast package management tool, uses the existing conda ecosystem, so Hurl can be installed 
with pixi:

```shell
$ pixi init hello-world
$ cd hello-world
$ pixi add hurl
```

There are, of course, a lot of [other ways to install Hurl]. If your preferred platform is not yet supported, drop-us
[an issue on GitHub]!

## Save Response per Request

Hurl can be used as a [testing tool], but it can be also simply used to get HTTP response when you've to chain multiple 
dependant requests (download a resource behind a login for instance). In a Hurl file, you can chain multiple requests, 
passing data from one to another:

{% raw %}
```hurl
# Get home:
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
csrf_token: xpath "string(//meta[@name='_csrf_token']/@content)"

# Do login!
POST https://example.org/login?user=toto&password=1234
X-CSRF-TOKEN: {{csrf_token}}
HTTP 302

# Get our precisous resource:
GET https://example.org/protected
HTTP 200
```
{% endraw %}

When run, Hurl outputs the last response body on the standard output (in this case the response of 
`GET https://example.org/protected`). Like curl, this response can be saved to a file with [`--output`] option:

```shell
$ hurl --output /tmp/response.json api.hurl
```

With [options sections], we can now save to file each individual response of 
any request. 

Let's imagine we have a cat API that returns a JSON response for a given cat. If we want to
save multiple cat images on disk, we can write this Hurl file:

1. Get the JSON response data for our first cat
2. Extract the image's URL of this cat
3. Save it to disk with [`--output`]
4. Get the JSON response data for our second cat
5. Extract the image's URL of this cat
6. Save it to disk with [`--output`]
7. Repeat...

Our Hurl file will look like this:

{% raw %}
```hurl
# Get our first cat resource and capture its image
GET https://catapi.com/cats/1
HTTP 200
[Captures]
img: jsonpath "$.url"

# Download its image and save it to disk
GET {{img}}
[Options]
output: cat1.jpg
HTTP 200

# Do the same with the second cat:
GET https://catapi.com/cats/2
HTTP 200
[Captures]
img: jsonpath "$.url"

# Download its image and save it to disk
GET {{img}}
[Options]
output: cat2.jpg
HTTP 200
```
{% endraw %}

## jsonpath Filter

Data can be captured and/or tested from HTTP responses using [JSONPath], [XPath], [regex] etc... [Filters] allow us to
even refine the extracted data. With the [new `jsonpath` filter], we're able to chain XPath or regex queries with a 
JSONPath filter:

For instance, given this HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p id="user"></p>

<script>
var s = '{"first_name" : "Sammy", "last_name" : "Shark", "location" : "Ocean"}';

var obj = JSON.parse(s);

document.getElementById("user").innerHTML =
"Name: " + obj.first_name + " " + obj.last_name + "<br>" +
"Location: " + obj.location;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

We want to extract the string `{"first_name" : "Sammy", "last_name" : "Shark", "location" : "Ocean"}` and analyse it as 
a JSON:

1. First, with a [`regex` query], we extract this string    
`regex /var s = '(.*)';/`
2. Then, with a [`jsonpath` filter], we test the data    
`jsonpath "$.first_name" == "Sammy"`

So our Hurl file will be:

```hurl
GET https://example.com/test.html
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
regex /var s = '(.*)';/ jsonpath "$.first_name" == "Sammy"
regex /var s = '(.*)';/ jsonpath "$.last_name" == "Shark"
regex /var s = '(.*)';/ jsonpath "$.location" == "Ocean"
```

Or with an intermediate [capture]:

```hurl
GET https://example.com/test.html
HTTP 200
[Captures]
s: regex /var s = '(.*)';/
[Asserts]
variable "s" jsonpath "$.first_name" == "Sammy"
variable "s" jsonpath "$.last_name" == "Shark"
variable "s" jsonpath "$.location" == "Ocean"
```

Check out [all the available filters] to get the data you want from the HTTP responses.

## More curl options: IPv6/IPv4, unix-socket etc...

Finally, in Hurl 4.2.0, more curl options have been implemented [`--ipv4` / `--ipv6`], [`--unix-socket`] and 
[`--location-trusted`].

### `--ipv4` / `--ipv6`

In a shell:


```shell
$ hurl --ipv6 foo.hurl
```

Or for a specific request in a Hurl file:

```hurl
GET https://foo.com
[Options]
ipv6: true
HTTP 200

GET https://foo.com
[Options]
ipv4: true
HTTP 200
```

### `--unix-socket`

In a shell:

```shell
$ hurl --unix-socket pid bar.hurl
```

Or for a specific request in a Hurl file:

```hurl
GET https://bar.com
[Options]
unix-socket: "pid"
HTTP 200
```

### `--location-trusted`

In a shell:

```shell
$ hurl --location-trusted baz.hurl
```

Or for a specific request in a Hurl file:

```hurl
GET https://baz.com
[Options]
location-trusted: true
HTTP 200
```

All the options can, of course, be combined on a specific request:

```hurl
GET https://baz.com
[Options]
ipv6: true
location-trusted: true
skip: false
HTTP 200
```

## Others

There are other improvements with Hurl 4.2.0 (dark mode for HTML report, skip option request, etc...) and also a lot of bug fixes,
you can check the complete list of enhancements and bug fixes [in our release note].

If you like Hurl, don't hesitate to [give us a star on GitHub] or share it on [Twitter]!

We'll be happy to hear from you, either for enhancement requests or for sharing your success story using Hurl!
